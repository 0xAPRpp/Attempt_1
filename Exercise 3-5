/*Exercise 3-5. Write a program that defines an enumeration of type Color where the
enumerators are Red, Green, Yellow, Purple, Blue, Black, and White. Define the type
for enumerators as an unsigned integer type and arrange for the integer value of each
enumerator to be the RGB combination for the color it represents (you can easily find
the hexadecimal RGB encoding of any color online). Create variables of type Color
initialized with enumerators for yellow, purple, and green. Access the enumerator value
and extract and output the RGB components as separate values.*/

# include <iostream>
int main()
{
	enum class color : unsigned int {Red = 0x00ff0000, Green = 0x0000ff00, Yellow = 0x00ffff00, Purple = 0x00800080, Blue = 0x000000ff, Black = 0x00000000, White = 0x00ffffff};

	color color1{color::Yellow};
	color color2{ color::Purple };
	color color3{ color::Green };

	std::cout << "Yellow is: " << "Red: " << std::hex << ((static_cast<int>(color1)) & 0x00ff0000);
