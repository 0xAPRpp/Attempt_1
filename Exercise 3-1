/*Exercise 3-1. Create a program that prompts for input of an integer and store it
as an int. Invert all the bits in the value and store the result. Output the original
value, the value with the bits inverted, and the inverted value plus 1, each in
hexadecimal representation and on one line. On the next line, output the same
numbers in decimal representation. These two lines should be formatted such that
they look like a table, where the values in the same column are right aligned in
a suitable field width. All hexadecimal values should have leading zeros so eight
hexadecimal digits always appear.
Note: Flipping all bits and adding oneâ€”ring any bells? Can you perhaps already deduce
what the output will be before you run the program?*/
