/*The gist of proper dynamic memory allocation is to reuse memory without allowing dangling pointers. Smart pointers allow you to do that without worrying about deallocating
memory or resetting the pointer as against raw pointers. However we should be concerned when we use the raw pointer inside the smart pointer using the get() and similar 
functions.
In order to reuse memory you should be done with whatever that is stored in that memory. 
In order to avoid a dangling pointer, you have to reset the dynamically allocated raw pointer pointing to it, this may not be needed if the pointer can be discarded, 
i.e, when the function finishes the execution the pointer will be removed from the stack and discarded. 
You should also discard all the other pointers storing that address which again will automatically be discarded if they are defined within the function 
when the function execution ends. 
We are passing a raw pointer from the smart pointer - sp_int_arr using the get() function to the called function. 
This passes the raw pointer. This means a raw pointer is now pointing to a memory location in the free store. 
This will be discarded after the function execution ends and as a result there are no raw pointers that can point to this memory location. 
This means that it is okay to pass the raw pointer inside a smart pointer as long as that pointer does not linger around in the program when it is not needed, 
however it is very important to understand to not let it get out of control by allowing the address 
to hang around at different places that will eventually make it difficult to trace. This is the reason to avoid copies also.*/

/*It is important to understand what is happening with the raw pointer from sp_int_arr.get(). As can be seen here, the raw pointer is passed to this function
 which uses it to read through the array and print its contents. The pointer is discarded after the function execution ends. As a result it does not matter if the pointer
 is not reset since there is no question of a dangling pointer as it is discarded after function execution. Since this function does not make copies of the raw pointer, 
 the pointer does not linger around and it is okay to pass it.*/
